# ⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game (X-O)

A classic command-line implementation of the timeless Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring player vs computer gameplay with modern emoji graphics and intelligent move validation.

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Player vs Computer**: Challenge an AI opponent with random move selection
- **Visual Board**: Clean emoji-based game board (⭕ ✖️ ⬜)
- **Move Validation**: Prevents invalid moves and occupied positions
- **Win Detection**: Automatic detection of wins, losses, and draws
- **Replay System**: Continuous gameplay with restart options
- **Symbol Selection**: Choose between X (✖️) or O (⭕)

### Technical Highlights
- **Game State Management**: Efficient board state tracking
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling for user input
- **AI Logic**: Random but valid computer move generation
- **Win Algorithm**: Comprehensive win condition checking (rows, columns, diagonals)
- **Memory Management**: Proper game state reset between rounds

## 🚀 How to Play

### Game Setup
1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script
2. **Choose Your Symbol**: Select between ✖️ (X) or ⭕ (O)
3. **View the Board**: Numbers 1-9 represent available positions:
   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Your Turn**: Enter a number (1-9) to place your symbol
2. **Computer Turn**: AI automatically makes its move
3. **Win Conditions**: Get 3 symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
4. **Game End**: Choose to play again or exit

### Core Algorithms

#### Win Detection Logic
```python
def check_winner(board, symbol):
    # Rows, Columns, and Diagonals check
    # Returns True if winning condition is met
```

#### Move Validation System
- **Position Range**: Validates input between 1-9
- **Availability Check**: Ensures position isn't already occupied
- **Board Mapping**: Converts linear position to 2D coordinates

## 🎯 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- No external dependencies required

### Quick Start
1. **Download the game:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HmodyCode999/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-game
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

3. **System Requirements:**
   - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Terminal/Command Prompt with emoji support
   - Minimal system resources required

## 🔮 Enhancement Opportunities
